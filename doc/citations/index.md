http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=587088 (warning, paywall)

Google says this is the properly formatted citation:

**Scalable XML Collaborative Editing with Undo (short paper)**

http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.3615

This is the short version of the paper. The long version is (http://hal.inria.fr/UNIV-MRS1/inria-00508436/en/)[this paper, I think], saved as <code>MUW-xmlcrdt-long.pdf</code>. That long version is cited in the short version as

>  S. Martin, P. Urso, and S. Weiss. Scalable XML Collaborative Editing with Undo. Research Report RR-7362, INRIA, 08 2010.

whilst the short version appears to have citation

> Martin, S., Urso, P., Weiss, S. (2010, October). Scalable XML Collaborative Editing with Undo short paper. In *CoRR*.

Google doesn't seem to have heard of this one. Which is weird; I must have found it *somehow*

**Google Wave Operational Transformation**
David Wang, Alex Mah, Soren Lassen

Not really an academic paper, just a note on a real-world implementation of the preceding. Note that the copy in the repository has (*almost* losslessly) reduced copies of the images embedded into it, to eliminate external dependencies.
