**Scalable XML Collaborative Editing with Undo (short paper)**
Stéphane Martin, Pascal Urso, Stéphane Weiss

http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.3615

This is the short version of the paper. The long version is (http://hal.inria.fr/UNIV-MRS1/inria-00508436/en/)[this paper, I think], saved as <code>MUW-xmlcrdt-long.pdf</code>. That long version is cited in the short version as

>  S. Martin, P. Urso, and S. Weiss. Scalable XML Collaborative Editing with Undo. Research Report RR-7362, INRIA, 08 2010.

whilst the short version appears to have citation

> Martin, S., Urso, P., Weiss, S. (2010, October). Scalable XML Collaborative Editing with Undo short paper. In *CoRR*.
