You know what, let's not do it in javascript, javascript is horrible. Means starting over with code and lots of interestingness for a webclient, but oh well (besides, have wanted to use Opal for a while). So let's do this in a sensible design-first order:

* Work out if GWave is actually safe to use for structured data/markup
    * Data's the easier one. It's markup where people want to do weird moves (and Wave's native format eliminates pretty much all of those).
* If above fails, actually make sure we're confident the abstract data model defined here is sane
    * Including where to put character attributes, because rich text editing kinda needs them.
    * Ensure it's representable in a way that duck types to DOM
    * As well as something that can represent selections whose endpoints aren't siblings
    * Can we define the effect on the document and clipboard of cutting a selection whose endpoints aren't siblings, in a sensible manner?
    * Make sure all of the above have sensible results when transforming/merging
    * Ensure merely *deleting* a node does sensible things with inserts that would be inside it (probably nothing, just warn the user).
* We have the DOM for applications to use this stuff, so can we yoink an existing editor?

The design generated by crossing all of these off is pretty good, but if we discover Wave is the right thing, it's not clear what the subsequent move is, so these are just stub items.

* C2S protocol
    * C2S API, maybe do this first
    * Detection of netadmins playing *les buggeures risibles*
    * Websocket as transport?
    * Make it usable as chat system?
* Persistence
* Authentication/access control
* Document bundles (ala the wave/wavelet distinction in Wave)
* Metadata documents.
